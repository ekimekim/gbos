Goal:
	A general-purpose mechanism for one or more tasks to be put to sleep
	until another task (or OS activity) triggers a wake of associated sleeping tasks.
This low-level syncronization primitive allows all manner of condition waiting,
without needing to resort to busy looping.
Examples:
	Waiting on long-lived (multiple time slices) exclusive locks to become available
	Waiting for a full queue (including OS-managed queues like graphics tile queue) to be non-full
	Waiting for an empty queue to be non-empty
And therefore solves the following current problems that we're currently busy-looping on:
	Waiting for a full graphics queue to have room to write new tiles
	Waiting for a button to be pressed

Design:
	Needs to be able to hold multiple task ids to wake
	However most common case will probably only be one task id
	Given this is something we need to wait for a while for, taking a fair chunk of CPU time should be ok.
	Option A: single task or malloc'd array
		3 forms:
			0, junk
			1, TASK_ID
			pointer to array
		Note the array address will never be in 0000-01ff (that's ROM, array is RAM) so 0,1 as magic values is safe.
		A leading 0 indicates no waiters, a leading 1 indicates a single waiter, specified as next byte, and anything else
		indicates it is a pointer to a ff-terminated array of task ids.
		Note allocated memory would need to always be MAX_TASKS long to avoid needing to realloc if we grow.
		Note we'd need to loop over all waiters everywhere (error-prone?) in order to remove dead task ids.
	Option B: Central list
		We observe that a task will only ever be waiting on at most one waiter.
		We keep a global list mapping task ids to waiter "IDs", either literally as a list of (task, waiter id)
		or by making current waiter an element of task.
		This makes invalidating dead tasks easy, but makes management harder since waiter ids now need to be allocated,
		and just in general makes them a special case.
		We could partially get around this by making the ids (bank, addr) though you need to be careful about WRAM0 vs WRAMX vs SRAMX.
